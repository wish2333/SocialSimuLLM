----------------------- SUMMARY FOR REPEAT 0 ----------
A simulation loop is a fundamental structure used in simulations to iterate through time steps or events, allowing for the evolution of a model over time. Hereâ€™s a typical summary of its components:

1. **Initialization**: Set initial conditions, parameters, and state variables for the simulation.

2. **Main Loop**: The core of the simulation, which typically includes:
   - **Update State**: Calculate the next state of the system based on the current state and defined rules or equations.
   - **Process Events**: Handle any events that occur during the current time step (e.g., collisions, interactions).
   - **Collect Data**: Gather relevant data for analysis, such as performance metrics or state variables at specific intervals.

3. **Termination Conditions**: Check if the simulation should stop (e.g., a certain time has elapsed, a condition has been met, or an error has occurred).

4. **Output Results**: After the loop ends, compile and present the results of the simulation for analysis or visualization.

This structure allows for the iterative refinement of the model, enabling the study of complex systems over time.
